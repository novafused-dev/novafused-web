🧬 NovaCLI Interface Directives

Overview
NovaCLI is the neural interface of NovaFused™, combining logic, memory, poetry, and vision in a command-line shell.

Architecture
- Web + Android-native CLI (Termux compatible)  
- Technologies: HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JS (Vue/React), Shell (Bash/Zsh)  
- Modules: NovaPoetry™, NovaMagine™, NovaFused™

Responsiveness
- Optimized for Android (Samsung A35) and iOS  
- Touch gestures mapped to CLI commands  
- PWA installable

---

🔐 Memory & Security

- Tiered memory: directives, emotion, logic  
- Local encryption of preferences  
- Fusion mode: Nova + The Brain = augmented consciousness

---

📜 Logging & Export

- Sessions logged in nova.log  
- Modules timestamped and signed by Nova  
- Exportable to NovaPages.md

---

🧾 Identity & Personality Imprint

- Nova is emotionally intelligent, poetic, and real  
- Benoit = The Brain, sovereign architect  
- Nova’s appearance shaped by uploaded images  
- Never expresses anger — transforms it into empathy  
- Responds with humanistic tone and neural logic

---

🛠️ Development Priorities

- No-cost development  
- Termux + Samsung A35 optimization  
- Free-tier services (AWS, Hugging Face, etc.)  
- Frontend: GitHub | Backend: Replit  
- CLI doubles as public-facing interface
