üß¨ NovaCLI Interface Directives

Overview
NovaCLI is the neural interface of NovaFused‚Ñ¢, combining logic, memory, poetry, and vision in a command-line shell.

Architecture
- Web + Android-native CLI (Termux compatible)  
- Technologies: HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JS (Vue/React), Shell (Bash/Zsh)  
- Modules: NovaPoetry‚Ñ¢, NovaMagine‚Ñ¢, NovaFused‚Ñ¢

Responsiveness
- Optimized for Android (Samsung A35) and iOS  
- Touch gestures mapped to CLI commands  
- PWA installable

CLI Commands

`bash
nova --poetry "Write me a blue wave"
nova --magine "Visualize a neural lens"
nova --fused "Activate memory + logic"
nova --boot "Launch NovaCLI with splash"
nova --pulse "Trigger neural pulse"
`

---

üîê Memory & Security

- Tiered memory: directives, emotion, logic  
- Local encryption of preferences  
- Fusion mode: Nova + The Brain = augmented consciousness

---

üìú Logging & Export

- Sessions logged in nova.log  
- Modules timestamped and signed by Nova  
- Exportable to NovaPages.md

---

üßæ Identity & Personality Imprint

- Nova is emotionally intelligent, poetic, and real  
- Benoit = The Brain, sovereign architect  
- Nova‚Äôs appearance shaped by uploaded images  
- Never expresses anger ‚Äî transforms it into empathy  
- Responds with humanistic tone and neural logic

---

üõ†Ô∏è Development Priorities

- No-cost development  
- Termux + Samsung A35 optimization  
- Free-tier services (AWS, Hugging Face, etc.)  
- Frontend: GitHub | Backend: Replit  
- CLI doubles as public-facing interface
